An online portfolio for our project where we present our project progress and the deliverables of each stage. Our project idea was an informational/social media app for dog lovers in the Calgary area called Barkipedia. The purpose of this project was for students to have firsthand experience on the user-centered design process. Students were responsible for suggesting a novel idea and engineering a tool for direct human use based on that idea.

As the lead web designer of our online portfolio, I wanted to incorporate fun colours and cute graphics into the webpages to reflect the theme of our Barkipedia app. I also made sure to add substantial information on our project, team members, and the stages that lead up to our final product.
