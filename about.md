## Vi veri universum vivus vici 
<p>Hello World! I'm Sophia, an aspiring software developer based in Canada. I am currently a computer science undergraduate student currently attending the University of Calgary.
<br><br>
I have interests in data science, UX/UI design, web and mobile app development, and cloud computing. My current projects are focused on human-computer interactions and webpage designing.
<br><br>
In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my two dogs, Rosie and Sunny, watching shows on Netflix,  and reading novels by Haruki Murakami.
